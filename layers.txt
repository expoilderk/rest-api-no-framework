N-Layers

database
	- a file which store all application data

src all source code
	- entities - object mappings
	- factories - instance generators
	- repositories - data access
	- routes - endpoint mappings
	- services - communication between the routes and repositories layer (business logic)
	- util - shared code
	- handler.ts - communication between routes and server
	- server.ts -  server instance

tests -> all automated test suites
	- integration tests - test on the user point of view. it's also an E2E test because
	there's no app consuming it

	- unit tests - all tests must run without any external connections such as
	databases, external APIs and on our case, the fileSystem
